In Catalogix Headless Platform, your company or organization is treated as a Workspace. Within the workspace, a store is defined as a channel for selling your products. Stores can be an eCommerce website in a specific country, a mobile app, a printed catalog, a chatbot, a 3rd party marketplace, or even physical retail locations.

Once you share your store's product feed or product images with Catalogix via our Feed API or using a CSV/XML file, we process your catalog and enable our APIs and services for your store.
