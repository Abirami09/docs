**What is a Product?** <br />
A product is a uniquely identified item in a store catalog which can be sold to customers. A product typically contains information such as an identifier (eg: SKU, Style Code, GTIN), a title, a description, images, brand name, price, sale price, and other such attributes.

**Where can it be implemented?** <br />
The APIs shown in the section below help you to create new products in the Catalogix platform, modify existing product information, and fetch product information which can be used in many ways such as populating the content of a Product Details Page.
