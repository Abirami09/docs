Catalogix's REST APIs use the API Key to authenticate and authorize calls. Follow the steps listed here to get started.

Step 1: Registering your store and getting API Key
Catalogix will register your store and provide you a API Key. Please reach out to support@catalogix.ai to get started.


Step 2: Calling an API
You can call any API included in your subscription using the generated API Key.
Pass the API Key in the header as follows:

apikey: {token}

You can use the same API Key for all APIs.
